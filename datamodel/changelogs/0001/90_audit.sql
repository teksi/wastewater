-- TODO : Is this comment still relevant :
-- Audited data. Lots of information is available, it's just a matter of how much
-- you really want to record. See:
--
--   http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/functions-info.html
--
-- Remember, every column you add takes up more audit table space and slows audit
-- inserts.
--
-- Every index you add has a big impact too, so avoid adding indexes to the
-- audit table unless you REALLY need them. The hstore GIST indexes are
-- particularly expensive.
--
-- It is sometimes worth copying the audit table, or a coarse subset of it that
-- you're interested in, into a temporary table where you CREATE any useful
-- indexes and do your analysis.
