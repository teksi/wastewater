.. _SWMM:

Storm Water Management Model (SWMM)
===================================

**Helps predict runoff quantity and quality from drainage systems**

`EPA's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) <https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm>`_  is used throughout the world for planning, analysis, and design related to stormwater runoff, combined and sanitary sewers, and other drainage systems.
It can be used to evaluate gray infrastructure stormwater control strategies, such as pipes and storm drains, and is a useful tool for creating cost-effective green/gray hybrid stormwater control solutions.
SWMM was developed to help support local, state, and national stormwater management objectives to reduce runoff through infiltration and retention, and help to reduce discharges that cause impairment of waterbodies.

The TWW SWMM plugin allows to:

* Easily export network data in the SWMM Input format (\*.inp),
* Run SWMM directly from TWW,
* Extract and take back the wanted SWMM results into TWW,
* Visualize them in different ways.
