TEKSI Module Management Tool
===============

.. attention::
This replaces the Data model tool that has been part of QGEP

The new plugin contains an advanced tool capable of initializing (and in future also upgrading) a TWW database.

It is aimed at system administrators and power users, and should not be used by end users, as it
could lead to data loss if not used properly.

For advanced cases, it is also possible to `upgrade your database manually <../db-update-pum/index.html>`_
