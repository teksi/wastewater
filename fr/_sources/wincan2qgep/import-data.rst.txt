Import data
============

Once the matching achieved, data can be imported using the ``Import button``.
A check will be first performed and the process will be stopped if any issue is found.
See :ref:`wincan2tww-fixing-issues`.

Once every selected channels and observations are correctly filled, data is imported within TWW data model in the VSA-DSS KEK extension.

.. note:: be aware that imported data is not easily removed at the moment, meaning there is no "Undo" button. Furthermore, if you import again, inspection data will just be inserted once again and therefore duplicated.
