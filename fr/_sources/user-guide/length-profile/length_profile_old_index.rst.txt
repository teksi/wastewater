Select the **vw_tww_cover** layer to select a starting point.

Then select a next manhole - it is not needed to be the direct next one. The tool automatically selects the manholes in between.
You can repeat this several times. If there is no continuity you will get a warning. Right click to finish your selection.

In the profile window you now have the length profile. You can see detail info about manholes.
If you hover over a manhole in the profile window you can see that the canvas correspondent gets highlighted in green.

Same goes for the reaches.
