Adding or Editing of Maintenance Events
=========================================


This represents a guide on how to add or edit maintenance event data in TWW.

General
-------

* Maintenance events can be connected to one structure or to many.
  Therefore TWW uses a intermediary RE_table to model the n:m relationship (**re_maintenance_event_wastewater_structure**)

* Maintenance events can be created or linked at the same time a new wastewater structure or a new reach is created.


Adding a new Maintenance Event
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Enable the edit mode.
* With the **Identify Features** tool you can select **wastewater_structures** or **reaches** by selecting their corresponding layer (**vw_tww_wastewater_structure** or **vw_tww_reach**).
* The respective form will open. Change to the **Maintenance_Events** tab.

* Create a new maintenance event with the **Add child feature** button.

 * Edit the new record in the vw_tww_maintenance_event form, then click **OK**

Link an existing Maintenance Event
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Enable the edit mode.
* With the **Identify Features** tool you can select **wastewater_structures** or **reaches** by selecting their corresponding layer (**vw_tww_wastewater_structure** or **vw_tww_reach**).
* The respective form will open. Change to the **Maintenance_Events** tab.

* Click the **Link existing child feature(s)** button.

 * Choose a maintenance event from the **Manage linked features for ...** window by choosing a record. Then click the **Link selected** button and **OK**

 * Close the windows with **OK** and turn of the edit mode to save changes


Unlink Maintenance Events
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Enable the edit mode.
* With the **Identify Features** tool you can select **wastewater_structures** or **reaches** by selecting their corresponding layer (**vw_tww_wastewater_structure** or **vw_tww_reach**).
* The respective form will open. Change to the **Maintenance_Events** tab.

* Select a maintenance event by clicking in the box (box gets yellow), then click the **Unlink selected child feature(s)** button.

 .. attention:: Unlink means, that there is only the record in the RE-table deleted. The maintenance event record itself is not deleted and can by linked with other wastewater structures. When using the **Delete selected child feature(s)** button, the maintenance_event- and the re_maintenance_event_wastewater_structure-record are deleted.


Editing
--------

 * Do as described in adding - but just edit existing maintenance events.
 * Or edit the **vw_tww_maintenance_event** table (in layer group **inspection**)


Multi Edit
-----------------------------------------------------------

Multi edit with linked tables is implemented in QGIS. It is possible to create or to link a maintenance event to a selection of reaches or wastewater structures in multiedit-mode.
